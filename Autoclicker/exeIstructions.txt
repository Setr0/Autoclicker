Hi, thank you to have looked the source code! :D
! This programm works only in Python3 !
To convert the script in a .exe file simply run
the .bat file (exe.bat). 
If you haven't got pyinstaller 
write pip install pyinstaller in your terminal.
If you are on Linux write
sudo pip3 install pyinstaller
and delete the window icon,
line 7 in Main.py
In linux it will be converted in a 
Linux file extension. 
For to run it write in your terminal
./EuropesFlags

Thank you again :D
